 E12 WRITING  
At the heart of the English curriculum is being able to clearly and 
succinctly express oneself in a written format. Contrary to belief, 
no one is a ‘naturally gifted’ or ‘born writer’ ; it is a skill that is 
learned through process and practice. Like a muscle, the more you 
properly  exercise your writing abilities, the stronger they will 
become.   
 
So if you need to exercise your writing muscles, where do you 
start?  
 
  Good writers are a lso readers: by exposing yourself to the well 
written work of others in novels, stories, and articles  will help 
you learn new ways to express your own ideas.  
 Plan before you write anything important – sometimes just 5 
minutes will help you plan and organiz e your ideas and result 
in stronger results.  
 Complete your written assignments early so that you can put 
them aside to come back the next day to correct a nd proof 
them. When writing anything, make sure that you stress that 
the idea/topic/theme is important  to the reader/world: 
essentially, answer the question ‘why do we care about what 
you are writing?’  
Paragraph Writing  English 12 
 
Title 
1. What is the title? 
This is the personal title that you choose for your piece of writing that is NOT the name of 
the assignment (which should be instead put in the header). 
2. What does it do? 
It is designed to attract and pique the reader’s interest in your writing.  
3. How do I write one?  
 Many writers think they must title their piece at the start: instead of writing it at the 
beginning, you can 
wait until you have finished your writing and choose a few 
interesting words from your conclusion instead.  
 Once you know your thesis, you can use the ‘main idea ’ to help generate a few words 
that encapsulate that main point.  
Example :                                                   The Best Place To Live 
Attention Getter 
1. What 
is the attention getter? 
This is the opening sentence to your paragraph that precedes your thesis or topic sentence 
and is connected to the main idea but generalized. 
2. What does it do? 
It is designed to attract and pique the reader’s interest in your writing.  
3. How do I write one?  
 Relate a dramatic anecdote. 
 Expose a commonly held belief. 
 Present surprising facts and statistics. 
 Use a fitting quotation. 
 Ask a provocative question. 
 Tell a vivid anecdote. 
 Define a key term. 
 Present an interesting observation. 
 Create a unique scenario.  
Example :                                                   The Best Place To Live 
If an exterritorial were to land on Earth, it would have its choice of over 190 countries 
in which to live. It would a difficult decision, but one country is certainly a better 
choice than most of the others.     
Topic/Thesis Sentence 
1. What is the topic/thesis sentence?   
The topic/thesis sentence is the core sentence in a paragraph and occurs after the attention 
getter .  
2. What does it do?   
It introduces the main idea of the paragraph and provides an indication of the points/ideas 
that will be used to prove the topic/thesis statement .  
2
Paragraph Writing  English 12 
 
3. How do I write one?   
Summarize the main idea of your paragraph. Indicate to the reader what your paragraph 
will be about.  
Example :                                                   The Best Place To Live 
If an exterritorial were to land on Earth, it would have its choice of over 190 countries in which 
to live. It would a difficult decision, but one country is certainly a better choice than most of the 
others. Canada is one of the best countries in the world due to its health care system, 
standard of education, and its urban centres.   
Supporting Details 
1. What are supporting sentences?   
They come after the topic sentence, making up the body of a paragraph.  
2. What do they do?   
They give details to develop and support the main idea of the paragraph.  
3. How do I write them?   
You should give supporting facts, details, quotations, and examples that are thoroughly 
explained . In senior level English classes, quotations and direct reference information is 
required (whether it is from online references or quotes from literature – you must support 
your ideas).  
 
Example :                                                   The Best Place To Live 
If an exterritorial were to land on Earth, it would have its choice of over 190 countries in 
which to live. It would a difficult decision, but one country is certainly a better choice than 
most of the others. Canada is one of the best countries in the world due to its health care 
system, standard of education, and its urban centres. First, Canada has a universal health 
care system which “comprehensive coverage for medically necessary hospital and 
physician services ” (Health Canada) . This allows all Canadians to have access to medical 
services regardless of their income or geographical location in the country. Second, 
Canada has a high standard of education that is also publically funded by all levels of 
government from kindergarten to secondary levels and has resulted in a 99% national 
literacy rate ( “Education in Canada ”). Finally, Canada's cities are clean and efficiently 
managed with both Calgary, Alberta and Ottawa, Ontario ranking first and fourth on the 
Sierra Club ’s cleanest cities in the world ( “Cleanest Cities ”).   
Closing Sentence 
1. What is the closing sentence?   
The closing sentence is the last sentence in a paragraph.  
2. What does it do?   
It restates the main idea of your paragraph and also tries to have a lasting impact or 
epiphany.  
3. How do I write one?   
Restate the main idea of the paragraph using different words.

care, education, and cities that would be a wonderf ul for anyone anywhere on the planet or 
in orbit above it.  
Citations/Works Cited  
1. What is the citation or works cited?   
A list of all source material consulted to craft the piece of writing  
2. What does it do?   
It helps show the material used to write the piece and avoid plagiarism or academic 
honesty, ensuring that the ideas of others are properly documented  
3. How do I write one?   
When ever you consult, refer to, or quote from a source, enter the information in MLA 
style using Son of Citation Machine at http://citationmachine.net/index2.php  and then

Prewriting 
The prewriting stage is when you think carefully and organize your ideas for your paragraph 
before you begin writing.  
Six Prewriting Steps:   
1. Think carefully about what you are going to write.  Ask yourself: What question am I going to 
answer in this paragraph or essay? How can I best answer this question? What is the most 
important part of my answer? How can I make an introductory sentence (or thesis statement) 
from the most important part of my answer? What facts or ideas can I use to support my 
introductory sentence? How can I make this paragraph or essay interesting? Do I need more 
facts on this topic? Where can I find more facts on this topic?  
2. Open your notebook.  Write out your answers to the above questions. You do not need to 
spend a lot of time doing this; just write enough to help you remember why and how you are 
going to write your paragraph or essay.  
3. Collect facts related to your paragraph or essay topic.  Look for and write down facts that 
will help you to answer your question. Timesaving hint: make sure the facts you are writing are 
related to the exact question you are going to answer in your paragraph or essay.  
4. Write down your own ideas.  Ask yourself: What else do I want to say about this topic? Why 
should people be interested in this topic? Why is this topic important?  
5. Find the main idea of your paragraph or essay.  Choose the most important point you are 
going to present. If you cannot decide which point is the most important, just choose one point 
and stick to it throughout your paragraph or essay.  
6. Organize your facts and ideas in a way that develops your main idea.  Once you have chosen 
the most important point of your paragraph or essay, you must find the best way to tell your 
reader about it. Look at the facts you have written. Look at your own ideas on the topic. Decide 
which facts and ideas will best support the main idea of your paragraph. Once you have chosen 
the facts and ideas you plan to use, ask yourself which order to put them in the paragraph. 
Write down your own note set that you can use as you write your paragraph or essay.

 Josefson’s Guide to Writing a Reflective Paragraph  
 
1. Opening Sentence (1)  : Introductory or topic sentence 
 Introduces the topic of the paragraph.  Don’t try to put everything into one sentence.  Don’t 
try too hard to capture reader interest.  Don’t cite the dictionary.  Ignore your high school 
teacher.   
 Provides a transition from the preceding paragraph by building on or referring to some idea 
in that paragraph.  This transition is more important than providing an in-depth explanation. 
Transitions provide logical flow . 
  
2. Explanatory Sentences (1- 3) : Explains the topic of the paragraph in more depth.  
 Always pu t your maximum effort into the second sentence of a paragraph.  It’s the REAL 
topic sentence. 
 Each sentence builds on and transitions to ideas in the preceding sentence.  The best way to 
do this is to use pronouns that have clear antecedents in the previous sentence.  (For 
example: Some students will complain my paragraph guidelines are stupid.  However, they 
are obviously wrong. They  in the second sentence is a pronoun with the antecedent some 
students  in the previous sentence.   
  
3. Exploratory Sentences (1-3) : Explores the author’s views on the topic by comparing and/ or 
contrasting them with the material being explained.  Exploration clarifies the author’s 
preconceptions so that they can be critically evaluated.  Exploration also helps to clarify the 
explanation of the topic. 
 Reflect on views you the author have held on the subject.  Say, for instance, Before I read 
this author, I thought that…   
 If you do not have clear preconceptions on the topic, explore what you might have thought 
about the issue before you encountered the new material you explained. 
 Exploratory sentences identify some conflict, confusion, or agreement between the new 
material and the author’s preconceptions that can serve as the basis for further analysis.  
  
4. Evidence Sentences (1- 4) : Provides evidence for the point being made in the paragraph.  There are 
several kinds of evidence, and you may use them in combination or more an one of each. Never 
begin a paragraph with evidence, as it obstructs flow. 
 Examples or illustrations .  Use For example , For instance , or tell a story based on your 
experience or common knowledge. 
 Quote from a text .  Always introduce a quote.  Never start a sentence with a quote.  Cite. 
8
 
 
 Paraphrase from a text .  Provide data or evidence from a text without quoting by explaining 
the views of an author in your own words.  Cite even when you are not quoting. 
 Logical analysis .  Explain why an idea or view is either logical or illogical by exploring 
fallacies or logic. 
  
5. Analysis Sentences (1- 3) : Just providing the evidence is not enough, especially when your evidence 
is a quote.  You need to analyze  the evidence in order to explain why it supports the idea of the 
paragraph. 
 For example: Dr. King says segregation “substitutes an ‘I -it’ relationship for an ‘I -thou’ 
relati onship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things” (King 1963, 13).  When 
he uses the word “thou”, he means it to invoke some of the sense of respect the word 
connotes from its frequent use in the Bible to refer to God.  
 Ideally your analysis should go beyond the evidence you provide from other sources to offer 
new insights into the topic.  Do this by drawing novel connections between sources, by 
examining singular similarities between contrasting views, by identifying distinct differences 
between largely similar views, or by exploring your own unique ideas on the topic.   
  
6. Synthesis Sentences (1-2): Do not just restate the central idea of the paragraph.  Rather, explore 
the implications or consequences of what you have said in the paragraph in a way that could point 
towards the next paragraph.  Synthesis explores the “now what?” question.  What action s are 
required because of the reflection presented in the paragraph. 
 For example, the implication  of the analysis of the King quote above could be: King’s lesson 
here points beyond the issue of segregation to direct us to identify all prejudices and 
institutions that keep us from treating others with the respect of a Thou.  There are still such 
institutions today . 
 If this is the last paragraph you should still suggest or imply certain actions  on the part of 
the reader, further explorations, or unresolved issues that could be addressed as a 
consequence  of the ideas presented in the paragraph.

Whenever writing a paragraph or an essay remember: TAG TIQs(x3) CE  
 Title 
Attention  
Getter  Your “TAG” (title & attention getter) is the 
section that taps your reader on the shoulder 
and says “follow me”. It is also the part you 
should write after you’ve done your thesis, 
support, and conclusion.  
 Thesis  
Integrate s 
Quotes  with 
Support  ( x3) The “TIQs” ( Thesis , Ideas  are Introduced  with 
Integrated Quotes  for Support ) is the core of 
your writing. Just like the checkmarks you want 
from your reader (the ticks or TIQs ), this 
section  provides the proof  and supports it with 
references and quotes . The smarter you are 
with your Integrated Quotes  (your IQ), the 
better your res ults (remember STATE , QUOTE , 
CLARIFY ).   
 Conclusion  
Epiphany  The ending of your work is the final impression; 
it’s the last thing your reader “sees”, so you 
want your conclusion to show that you have 
proven your thesis and have the epiphany 
where your reader “CE’s” you’ve made your 
point.  
10
Get to the  
POINT! 
 Support your ideas  by providing insight  and not 
simply retelling story details . Only use plot 
details to briefly convey context and instead 
focus on character, setting, conflict, and theme . 
 
 
11
Supporting Your Ideas by Using Quotes (SQC) : Review  
 
When you are asked to respond to a piece of literature, you are being asked to show y our 
interpretation and understanding of the work and how it applies to life. Your readers sincerely want to 
know what you make of the story, poem, play, etc. Most people believe that more than one interpretation 
is possible or even likely. 
How can you be most effective in doing this?  When you present your ideas, you can make your 
int
erpretation more clear if you refer specifically  to the text by summarizing, paraphrasing, or quoting; 
usually a combination is most effective. Please see the following site for more specific details: 
http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/1/ . 
This document deals with using quotes to support your ideas. In responses, one format you will 
be asked to use is the literary paragraph  to support your interpretation of a text. For this document, I’ll 
will use Daniel Keyes short story, “Flowers for Algernon” as an example.  
Suppose I ask you to identify how Charlie Gordon’s desires develop through the story and ask 
you to use Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs  to analyze this (Please see the following site 
for details: http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html .)  Near the start of the story we can find a 
quote that makes Charlie’s desires fairly clear: “When I become intelligent like Doctor Strauss with 
three
 times my I.Q. of 68, then maybe people will like me and be friendly” (Keyes 82).  Now that we 
have a
 useful quote that shows what Charlie’s goal is, we can create a sequence of ideas that use the 
State-Quote-Clarify approach to quote integration; i.e. we make a statement, provide a quote as evidence 
and then clarify how the quote supports out statement. After that sequence, we can go on to make another 
statement, support it with a quote, clarification the support, and so on. How does it work? 
1. State: Charlie wants to be smarter 
2. Quote: “When I become more intelligent…then maybe more people will like me.” 
3. Clarify: Charlie believes that people dislike him because he is not as smart as they are. 
In paragraph form: 
At the beginning of the story, Charlie Gordon wants to increase his intelligence through an 
experiment, believing that when he becomes more intelligent, “maybe more people will like [him] (82).” 
Charlie knows that people make fun of him at work, and believes it is his lack of intelligence that is the 
reason; he doesn’t realize that the cruel behaviour of others shows their lack of humanity and compassion : 
Charlie is not the problem. 
12
Now, I want to synthesize the ideas of author Daniel Keyes and psychologist Abraham Maslow, 
so I just add in the idea of the need to belong from Maslow’s hierarchy: 
Maslow illustrates in his theory of motivation that we all need to belong to groups and be 
res
pected by their members. Charlie is like everyone else in this sense: he wants to feel that he belongs 
when he is at work, yet people make fun of him, possibly thinking he isn’t aware of their jokes at his 
expense. Consequently, at the beginning of “Flowers for Algernon,” Charlie plans to participate in an 
experiment that will increase his intelligence, believing maybe this way “more people will like [him] 
(82).” Charlie knows  that people make fun of him at work, but he believes it is his lack of intelligence that 
is the reason; he doesn’t realize that the cruel behaviour of others shows their lack of humanity and 
compas
sion, and that there is really nothing wrong with him the way he is. 
We could go on from here, and show how Charlie ’s understanding changes by the middle and at 
the e
nd of the book by using additional quotes. In the example above we used Maslow as a way to blend 
in our awareness of what motivates people to behave the way they do. We could, if the assignment called 
for it, also use Maslow’s hierarchy to make inferences about why Charlie’s coworkers make fun of him. 
The use of transitions and markers that create unity will be important (separate document). 
 
 
13
Answering questions regarding “Flowers for Algernon” using the  
State/Quote/Clarify Method 
Steps: 
1. Read the question and think about what it is asking. 
2. If you think you know the answer, write down your answer in note form. 
3. Find the best quote to support your answer. This is your evidence that shows what you 
say is true and accurate. 
4. Write your answer using the State/Quote/Clarify  method.  
a. State: this is your answer. Example  
i. Question. What is different about Charlie? 
ii. State: Charlie is mentally handicapped . 
b. Quote: “When I become intelligent like Dr. Strauss with three times my I.Q. of 
68, then maybe I’ll be like everyone else and people will like me and be friendly.”  
c. Clarify: An I.Q. of 68 is low compared to most people . 
d. Full answer 
One part of Charlie’s character that is different from most people is that he is 
mentally handicapped. He hopes the operation will make him smarter as he says, 
“When I become intelligent like Doctor Strauss with three times my I.Q. of 68, then 
maybe people will like me and be friendly.” An I.Q. o f 68 is low compared to most 
people,  and we can see evidence of the intellectual difficulties that Charlie faces at 
the beginning of the story in the way he writes with many grammatical and spelling 
problems and fairly simple ideas.

Step- by-step Process for Writing your Poem Synopsis using STATE /QUOTE /CLARIFY  
 
1. Make sure you know what happens in your poem (or piece of literature). 
2. Take a step back from the actual events, characters, and situation of the poem. 
3. Figure out what the poet is trying to say about life or how people deal with problems. This is theme 
of the poem. Most of your work is now done .  
4. Now state the theme . Everything else that follows is just you proving that your theme is accurate. 
That is, you will provide three quotes from the poem showing the theme runs through the entire 
piece of literature. 
5. Now you are ready to write your first sentence: 
Fill in the blanks: In “_________________ ,” so and so presents a speaker who __________________ 
_______________________________________________________________________________ to 
convey the idea that _______________________________________________. 
 
Example: I am a Rock 
A. In “I am a Rock, ” Simon and Garfunkel present a speaker who has withdrawn from people after 
being hurt by someone he loves  to convey the idea that , when we have been emotionally 
wounded, we may completely withdraw from everyone for some time. 
B. Now we just need three quotes from the poem to prove our theme: one from the beginning, one 
from near the middle, and one from near the end. These will be presented using the 
state /quote/ clarify  method. 
a. Quote 1: 
From the very beginning of the poem, the speaker has withdrawn , claiming it is a 
“deep and dark December” and “I am alone”.   The speaker’s isolation is emphasized 
by the darkness and the depth of the cold.  
b. Quote 2: 
The speaker has emotionally retreated within “…walls  / a fortress deep and mighty / 
that none may penetrate.”  The walls are an effective metaphor for how he has pulled 
away from people and into himself where he can be safe from harm; if someone tries 
to talk with the speaker, he will probably only answer briefly and perhaps he will even 
be rude and this behaviour will keep people away. 
c. Quote 3: 
It seems quite clear that the speaker has been emotionally injured by someone for 
whom he cared deeply because he says,  “If I’d never loved, I never would have cried .” 
At this point, the speaker believes the risk of loving someone is not worth the pain 
one will experience if that person leaves one. 
 
C. Concluding Sentence . Now you need to wrap up your paragraph by showing the reader why this 
matters. In other words, answer the questions “So what?” and “Who cares?”  In this case, it seems 
one lesson is that loving someone carries the potential for pain. This also seems inescapable  and 
that the only way to avoid pain is by not risking love. But what kind of life would that be? We must 
also ask what might be gained by falling in love with someone who returns that love. What could be 
better than that experience? So, we understand that the potential for fulfillment in love is great but 
also that pain might also be part of the situation. If we are wounded by the loss of the person we 
love, we may expect to feel like the speaker in the poem, at least for a while. Now, how can we get 
all that into one sentence? Get back to the theme 
Example: 
By clearly showing us the effects of losing someone we love, the poets help us 
understand that withdrawing from human contact after an emotional injury is a 
normal reaction and that we can expect this of ourselves or of those in our lives who 
experience similar losses; it is a sad but inescapable part of being human.

Basic Poetry Paragraph Response Writing 
Findley  sfindley@sd43.bc.ca  
Discuss the poet’s use of allusion with reference to the poem “Siren Song” by Margaret Atwood.  
 
 C- to  C Range  C+ to B  Range  A Range  
Topic Sentence(s)  In “Siren Song” by Margaret 
Atwood there are several 
examples of allusion.  Poets often use the poetic device 
allusion to improve the depth of a 
poem. In her poem “Siren Song”, 
Margaret Atwood uses references 
to mythology a nd history to create 
connections for the reader.  When a poet decides to make use 
of allusion, she enhances the 
ability for the reader to connect 
with the characters and the theme 
of her poem. Margaret Atwood 
does this in her poem “Siren 
Song” as the reade r comes to feel 
the sorrow of the narrator and her 
tragic enslavement to her own 
nature.  
Supporting Sentences  In lines 2 -3 Atwood writes about a 
siren who sings a song that is 
“irresistible” and “forces men” to 
their deaths (3, 4). The men die 
even though  they can “see the 
beached skulls” (6). This is an 
allusion to men dying during an 
invasion during D -Day. The siren of mythology was an 
ancient creature with feathers that 
sang a song. Men who heard the 
song were lured to their deaths on 
the rocks around a n island. The 
siren narrator says “the song / that 
is irresistible” (2 -3) and that it 
“forces men to leap overboard in 
squadrons” (5). This reference to 
soldiers going to their deaths 
during an invasion also provides a 
depth an image for the reader.   As the mythical Siren sings “the 
song / that is irresistible” to men 
we are reminded of Homer’s 
ancient Greek myth Ullyses (2 -3) 
These birdlike creatures lured 
men to their deaths on the rocks 
as their “boring song…works 
every time” (26 -27). Atwood 
furthers th is magical call of the 
siren by alluding to soldiers an 
invasion; even though the men 
can “see the beached skulls,” they 
still jump to their deaths (6)  
Concluding Sentence(s)  By using allusion, Atwood has 
created a very good poem that 
makes connections f or the reader.  By using allusion, Atwood creates 
a poem that makes the reader 
think of men going to their deaths 
lured onto the rocks by mythical 
creatures of the past.  By using these mythical and 
historical references, the woman 
of the poem is given a de ep 
pathos; she cannot resist her own 
abilities and nature and is just as 
doomed as those she lures to their 
deaths.

he cannot escape it so long as he is

security until he is home ––if he makes it 
home safe and alive.  
PARAGRAPH: Use your notes from a bove to write a paragraph in which you analyze the character.  The main question you are 
writing to answer is: What does this story and the character’s behavior reveal about them as a person? Use specific examples and 
quotations from the story to support a nd illustrate your ideas. Finally, begin your paragraph by establishing a focus (a subject + a 
point about that subject) in your opening line.  
 
Private First Class Paul Berlin, a boy who thinks about campouts with his dad and “pretends he [is] not a 
soldie r,” is not yet the man a soldier needs to be if he is to survive in combat. While a soldier would focus 
on war strategies and the enemy, PFC Paul Berlin uses “tricks…to keep [himself] thinking.” He counts ––his 
steps, money, anything ––to distract him. He al so sings, in this case the old song “Where Have You Gone 
Charming Billy?” And he daydreams, mostly of the beach and how he will feel when he gets there. He 
imagines “digging a hole in the sand and sleep[ing] like the high clouds…and not [being] afraid anym ore.” Yet 
none of these techniques work. Instead, they only remind him of where he is (in a war zone in Vietnam), 
where he is not (at home, with his family), and what really happened (Billy Boy Watkins dying of a heart 
attack). Eventually PFC Paul Berlin i s overwhelmed by his fears, an experience which endangers his comrades 
but transforms him into the man be needs to be. The experience teaches him what he needs to know if he is 
to survive, but it also teaches him that so long as he is there he will not fee l safe, even when he gets to the 
beach where he dreamed he would. At the beach, he will “bathe in the sea,” “forgetting how frightened he 
had been,” and emerge from the sea as a man cleansed of whatever sins war made him commit.

 FOUNDATION WRITING WITH SHORT STORIES  
Using short stories to practice effective paragraph/mini -essay writing with quotations  
 Thesis Creation: Using your thesis idea, create a single statement that clearly explains what you 
intend to prove in your essay (your thesis statement  is usually connected to a theme statement)

 PROOF STATEMENT  
Now Write it:  Using your thesis and quotations, write your response with an introductory sentence, 
your thesis, supporting body, and a conclusion. Remember that you should be incorporating 
quotations and following these guidelines. 
1. The reader should only 
hear one voice, which is that of the writer only (YOU!) 
2. Avoid introducing quotations with “He said/She said” or “In this quotation...”.  
3. Take only the segment of the sentence that you need; you do not need to take the whole 
sentence. 
4. If you need to make changes for the sake of grammar, verb tense, or clarification of 
noun/speaker, mark these with [ ]. 
5. Remember always to indicate the significance of the quote within the same sentence or directly 
afterwards.

Institute of Communications Studies - Study Skills
ESSAY-WRITING
THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE
In a subject like Communications Studies, much of your university work will be assessed by
essay – whether that’s an essay you prepare in your own time over a period of days or weeks,or one you concoct in an examination hall in the space of an hour. It therefore follows that if
you learn how to prepare, organise and present essays, you will do much better in your degree
overall. So this document might also be called:
HOW TO GET BETTER MARKS WITHOUT (NECESSARILY) DOING MORE WORK
We’ll assume that you’ve read widely about the particular subject of your essay, and have a
good understanding of the broader area within which that topic is located. Broad and deep
research is the essential basis of an essay. You will have lots of notes on the subject – see the
ICS Study Skills Guide to Note-Making  for tips on how to do this.
So now it’s time to write the essay. You sit down in front of the keyboard and start typing: you
put the title, you try to group some similar bits of information or argument together, and thenyou put a conclusion on the end saying that there are many interesting points of view on thissubject, right?
No, of course you don’t. You’ve got to start off with an essay plan. By designing this you’ll
come up with the structure . A well thought-out structure is at the heart of every good essay.
What is a good structure?
I t  i s n ’ t  e n o u g h  t o  m a k e  s u r e  t h a t  y o u  h a v e  a n
introduction at the start, a conclusion at the end, andthe other stuff in between. So what do you need?
1. You do need a solid introduction. It will probably
contain something about how you have interpreted the
question, and it is often a good idea to state a thesis(an argument) which you are going to illustrate orexplore in the body of the essay – although you mayprefer to save the ‘findings’ of your exploration to theend, in which case you have to introduce the questioncarefully at the start.
2. And you need a tight, powerful conclusion which is
the logical consequence of everything that has gone before .
The good essay has developed a number of related
strands which the conclusion ties together. It may also
contain an extra, surprising thing which you saved to
throw in at the end with a flourish.
3. So what happens in between? Well…Six really awful ways to begin the
essay ‘Why have baked beans
become so popular in twentieth
century Britain?’:
“The question of why baked beans
have become so popular in twentiethcentury Britain is an interesting…”
“The Oxford English Dictionary
defines ‘baked beans’ as…”
“In this essay I will explore the
question of why baked beans havebecome so popular in twentieth…”
“The Penguin English Dictionary
defines ‘popular’ as…”
“The twentieth century has been going
for quite a while now and…”
“The Collins English Dictionary
defines ‘twentieth century’ as…”
! Why are these awful? Because
they are so predictable, uninspiringand limp. What should you doinstead? Something else.
21
2You need to organise your material so that it flows from one area, sub-section or argument to
the next in a logical order. Each part should build upon, or at least reasonably follow on from,the previous parts, and the whole thing should bepulling the reader, clearly and inescapably, to yourtriumphant conclusion.
The box on the right shows unimaginative kinds of
essay structure, which are likely to get low marks.But what can you do instead?
One good approach  is to look through your notes
and identify a handful of themes within the
discussion, and to structure your essay around
consideration of those. You should order theanalysis of each theme so that the essay builds uptowards the conclusion.
DON’T KNOW HOW TO START?
If you’ve got some notes but you don’t know how to start the next stage, get a nice big clean
sheet of paper and write down phrases which summarise all of your thoughts about the
subject, the different questions and ideas you’ve had in your mind, and the areas and problemsthat have been covered in your reading. Then look for similarities, and related concerns, andgroup them together in whatever way makes sense to you. After that, see if you can numberthese areas into an order – the order in which you will weave your way through the material.And voila! You’ve accidentally created an essay structure. Now just check it, tweak it a bit tomake it more coherent, and you’re ready to go.
More analysis = more marks
You will often need to describe  something before you give an analysis  of it. But the more
analysis the better. Only include as much description as is needed for the analysis to make
sense. The analysis is what you will get the marks for. Of course, a muddled, illogical and
unsubstantiated analysis can still leave you with no marks. We’ll be looking for a clear ,
coherent  and consistent analysis , supported by evidence .
Don’t just repeat what some books (or your lecture notes) say – we want your analysis.
However, you should also show your awareness of other people’s analyses!
Don’t wander off the subject
Answer the question, and only the question. And keep checking that you are remaining on
track throughout the essay. If there’s something interesting that you want to include, but
which is of dubious relevance to the main argument or theme of the essay, put it in a footnote .
Don’t rush
You might remember that you ‘did all right’ last time you stayed up all night on
pharmaceuticals, the day before the deadline, to research and write an essay. But this most
likely means that you would have done much better  if you had started reading and researching,
and then writing, days or weeks before that. It is always obvious to your tutors when an essay
is rushed.
Don’t cheat
Plagiarism – using other people’s words and ideas without acknowledging where you got them
from – is regarded as an enormous sin, the penalties for which are actually worse  than just
getting zero for the essay. Just say no. Or more specifically, make sure that you have got
perfect references: see pages 4
 – 5.Two dull kinds of essay structure:
The one that’s not well enough organised:
1. Definition of the thing
2. Some stuff about the thing3. Summary
The one that’s too formulaic:
1. Introduction, saying that we will
discuss the thing
2. Three arguments in favour of the
thing
3. Three arguments against the thing
4. Summary of the above
22
3Style as well as substance
Whilst it would seem ‘nice’ if the ideas of a genius would be appreciated even when written in
horrible prose, you should not bank on this. The good student not only has good ideas to write
about, but can write about them well. And it seems particularly wasteful to be losing marks
just because you didn’t spend a little bit of time learning a few style tips.
WAFFLE AND PADDING: NOT THE KEYS TO SUCCESS
Don’t use superfluous words, phrases or sentences. If a sentence means the same thing with a
word taken out, take it out. The same applies to whole phrases and sentences within the widercontext of a paragraph. Using words and phrases which don’t add anything to what you’resaying will mean that your examiners will conclude that (a) you don’t have enough to say to
meet the required essay length, and that (b) you are trying to hide this by means of a slow,
repetitive and boring writing style. Which is not clever.
For example — don’t  write: When you could write:
Greg Dyke transformed the BBC, changing it so
that it was altogether different from what it hadbeen like before.Greg Dyke transformed the BBC.
Some people feel that he is a megalomaniacwho wants to take over the world, whilst at the
same time other people feel that he is a
fundamentally weak man who lacks strength.Some people feel he is a megalomaniac; others
contend that he is fundamentally weak.
Nevertheless, we can certainly see that he
clearly wields a considerable and substantialdegree of direct power, influence and the ability
to change things around within the
organisation.Nevertheless, he clearly has a considerabledegree of direct power within the organisation.
The left hand column contains 250 per cent more words than the right-hand column, but it
contains zero per cent more information. Your examiners spot this kind of thing.
Furthermore, by not inflating her essay with space-filling nonsense, the pithy writer of the
right-hand column has got room to show her understanding of the subject by expanding on all
of these points: what  did Dyke do? Why might he be seen as power-crazed, or weak? How has
he demonstrated his personal power? In other words, she has got room for lots of analysis ,
which, as we established above, is good news.
CAN I SAY “I FEEL THIS ARGUMENT IS WRONG BECAUSE...”?
There are different preferences about whether you should say “I” in an essay or not.
Sometimes it can look really good if you confidently say “Rather, I would argue that...”. Butsaying “I feel this argument is wrong because...” can look a bit ponderous, and some tutorsdon’t like it. A solution to this is to be even more assertive and say “However, this argument is
weak, since...”. It will still be clear to your examiners that you are making your own argument
– and we definitely do  like you to make your own argument. Whatever you are saying, make
sure you back it up with argument  and evidence .
SURELY THIS STUFF ABOUT ‘STYLE’ IS JUST SUPERFICIAL AND ISN’T VERY IMPORTANT?
Wrong. If your essay is badly-written, you will be losing marks. And, in the outside world,
you would be losing readers (whether you are writing books and screenplays, or companyreports and letters... or even job applications!). It is very important to write in a crisp, clearstyle, with good sentence construction and proper punctuation. Needless to say, spelling
mistakes also fail to impress.
23
4TWO MORE EXAMPLES OF BAD WRITING
Bad thing: What’s wrong with it?:
The film was
criticised for it’s
drug-taking,
violence, etc.! You only put an apostrophe in “it’s” where you are using it as an abbreviation of
“it is” (e.g. “it’s a great film”).
! The writer should really have put “…criticised for its depictions of drug-
taking…” – otherwise the reader might wrongly infer that the production  of the film
involved actual drug-taking and violence, for example.
! The use of ‘etc.’ shows that the writer wanted to suggest that the film had been
criticised for other things, but hadn’t got a clue what these were. It’s better to
simply say: “The film was criticised for its depictions of drug-taking and violence”.
The theory was
very popular,
Foucault was
said to be ‘morepopular than the
Beatles’.! Two units of meaning – parts that could stand alone as sentences, such as “The
theory was very popular” – cannot just be strung together with a comma in the
middle. In this case, the comma could be replaced with a full stop, or a semi-colon
(which represents a more emphatic pause than a comma, and suggests a connection
between the material before and after it). Or add a connecting word: “The theory
was very popular, and Foucault was said to be ‘more popular than the Beatles’”.
! You want a reference for that quote, of course, too.
References
As you may know, there are a range of different ways of writing references. Some of them
involve using footnotes, or having separate lists called ‘References’ and ‘Bibliography’, andgenerally give you a headache. We therefore recommend the ‘Harvard’ system of referencing,which is straightforward, and widely-used by publishers and academics.
THE HARVARD REFERENCE SYSTEM
It’s quite simple. When you quote or paraphrase something, you cite the author’s last name,the year of publication, and the page reference, in brackets. For example:
The popularity of baked beans soared when Elvis Presley was seen to eat six whole tins on Entertainment
Tonight  in 1959 (Heinz, 2000: 34).
At the end of the essay you then include a ‘References’ section which must include every itemyou’ve referred to in the essay. If there are two or more works by an author published in thesame year, distinguish them as 2000a, 2000b, and so on. References are written in thefollowing style:
Type of reference: Example of reference:
Book Heinz, Edward (2000) A History of Baked Beans , London: Arnold.
Article in book Johnson, Sarah (1998a) ‘The Cornflake in History’ in Norman Jennings (ed.)
Food for Thought , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.
Article in journal Johnson, Sarah (1998b) ‘Deconstructing the pre-millennial diet: Special K and
postmodernism’, Cultural Studies 11, 1: 32–44.
Explanation : This means that an article by Sarah Johnson called ‘Deconstructing the pre-
millennial diet: Special K and postmodernism’ was published in the journal Cultural Studies ,
volume  11, number 1, on pages 32 to 44. This issue of the journal was published in 1998.
The piece is listed here as ‘(1998b)’ since it’s the second of two articles by Sarah Johnson,
which we are referring to, published in 1998.
Article in
newspaperRatner, Clifford (2000) ‘Magazine sparks love feud’, The Independent ,
10 October 2000,  Thursday Review  section: 14.
Article from theinternetWherever possible, identify the author, so you can have a reference like this:
Holmes, Amy (2000), ‘Greenpeace wins media war’, at http://www.independent.
co.uk/international/green25.htm (accessed: 25 November 2000).
Always state the date you visited the site. If you can’t state the author, have a reference like this:
BBC Online (2000) ‘Radical autumn shake-up’, at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10276.htm (accessed: 8 December 2000).
24
5And that’s it. The Harvard system is easy to use, relatively simple to produce, and the reader
doesn’t need to keep stopping to look up references in footnotes. Instead, as you write your
essay you can use footnotes  for extra bits of information which are surplus to requirements in
the main body of the essay, such as extra details about the subject, or interesting quotes.
However, remember that when writing footnotes, just as when you are writing the main body
of the essay, you should draw out the relevance  of the material you are using. Use them to
enhance the impact of your argument.

Literary	  Thesis	  Generator 	  
© 2008 Jim Burke. May photocopy for classroom use only. Visit www.englishcompanion.com  for more resources.  Topic:  Compare and contrast the different types of relationships humans have with nature. Include examples 
from your own experience and the different texts we have read or viewed. After comparing and 
contrasting, make a claim about what you feel are our rights and responsibilities toward the natural 
world in general. Provide reasons and evidence to support your claim. 
 Example 
1. Identify the subject  of your paper  The development of one’s own identity.  
2. Turn your subject into a guiding 
question  How does a yo ung man go about developing his own 
identity apart from his parents?  
3. Answer your question with a 
statement  Telemachus realizes that he must set out on his own 
journey to find his own identity.  
4. Refine this statement into a working  
thesis  In the absence of  his father, Telemachus assumes the 
role, sending himself on a quest that will transform him 
into the man he needs to be.  
 
1. Identify the subject  of your paper   
2. Turn your subject into a guiding 
question   
3. Answer your question with a 
statement   
4. Refine this  statement into a working  
thesis   
 
For a nonliterary paper, I use the following variation: 
 
1. Identify the subject  of your paper  Relationships between teenagers and their parents  
2. Turn your subject into a guiding 
question  How does the relationship between t eenagers and their 
parents change?  
3. Answer your question with a 
statement  As teens grow more independent, they resent and 
resist the limitations and expectations their parents 
impose on them.  
4. Refine this statement into a working  
thesis  Conflict between te enagers and their parents is a 
difficult but necessary stage in kids’ development.

Writing Terms 12 
 
This list of terms builds on the preceding lists you have been given  
in grades 9-11.  It contains all the terms you were responsible for learning in the past, as well 
as the new terms you are now responsible for learning for the exam.   
o The new terms are marked with (NT): New Term.  
o Government exam terms are marked with an asterisk (*). 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Audience *:  The particular individual or group to which a piece of writing is addressed 
or appeals. 
 
 Form*: Form refers to genre, as writing can take the form of a story, or poem, or script 
for a play, for example. It can also refer to the shape or structure of the writing, as an 
essay, for instance, may use the chronological form or the climactic order form as an 
organizational technique (see below for details). 
 
 Purpose *: The author may have one or more purposes in a piece of writing; these 
include the desire to inform, satirize, criticize, persuade, entertain or argue, etc. Be 
careful in assigning an author’s “purpose” to a work without appropriate  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
The Paragraph 
 
 Narrative* Paragraph:  Narrative paragraphs tell a story, often a segment from the 
narrator’s life, and the lesson to be learned from the story (which is the thesis). Short 
anecdotes are written in narrative paragraphs, and, like short stories, they have climax.  
 
 Descriptive* Paragraph:  Descriptive paragraphs describe a scene or a collection of 
scenes, and rely more on description than action or character to make their point. In 
fact, often nothing really happens at all in a descriptive paragraph. These paragraphs 
are like written photographs in that they simply describe a scene.  
 
 Expository* Paragraph:  This paragraph is the basis for the typical essay written for 
school. In a single paragraph, the writer either persuades the reader to a particular 
point of view or explains something to the reader. The first type of expository 
paragraph is called the persuasive or argumentative paragraph; the second is called the 
explanatory.  
 
 
The Essay 
 
An essay is a short piece of prose (comparable in length to the short story in that it can be 
read in a single sitting) that analyses a subject or offers an argument on a topic. “ Essais ” 
means “to attempt” or “try out” in French, which is exactly what an essayist does in his/her 
writing – tries out a few thoughts on a topic. When writing an essay, there are several 
primary considerations for the writer: 
27
 
 
 
A. Essay Structure  
 
An essay is comprised of a minimum of three paragraphs. There isn’t really a magic number 
of paragraphs.  A typical “canned” structure for an essay is the five paragraph form.  T he 
essay is broken into an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion.  This is one 
structure; essays can take a longer multi-paragraphed form.  
 
 Introduction:  This is the first paragraph or two of an essay and is where the reader is 
made aware of the purpose for the piece of writing. The introduction provides 
information on the topic and allows the reader to figure out what kind of essay it is.  
 
 Thesis:  This is the main idea of the essay, which ties the whole piece together. It is like 
the theme in a short story.  Usually, the thesis is stated explicitly, most often in the 
opening paragraph. The thesis is most often expressed as a single sentence, otherwise 
known as the thesis statement. 
 
 Transitions: These are words that allow the reader to slide smoothly from one idea to 
the next or one paragraph to the next (however, therefore, nevertheless, as a result, 
etc.). 
 
 Body: This is the bulk of the essay, where most information is provided (where one 
proves the thesis).  
 
 Conclusion:  The end of the essay, usually one or two paragraphs in length, where the 
writer wraps up the argument or otherwise ties together the content of the essay for 
the reader.  
 
B. Types of Essays 
Essays can be either formal* or informal, depending on the language and style selected by 
the writer (see language and style below). There are many different types of essays, 
including narrative, but four main categories follow. In general, the narrative, descriptive, 
and personal essays are informal while the expository and literary are formal, but even 
these guidelines are flexible.  
 
 Descriptive*:  An essay in which the main objective is to engage the senses and convey 
the essence of a character and/or place rather than plot (as in a narrative essay) or 
ideas (as in an expository essa y). Just as an artist’s paint strokes can capture a 
personality or setting, an author’s words illustrate its subject in a moment in time when 
depicted in a descriptive essay.  
 
 Personal*: The personal essay is an extension of the narrative and/or descriptive 
paragraphs described above. In i
t, a writer describes a situation in which he/she 
learned something profound or discovered something about life. These essays are 
written in first person point of view.  
 
 Expository*:  This is the most common essay form used in school. Expository essays 
persuade or explain, are written in third person point of view, and follow a fairly strict 
format. Typical expository essay writing techniques (HOW a writer explains or 
28
persuades) include cause and effect and compare/contrast, although there are many, 
many more other approaches. Exposition is therefore writing that conveys information 
or explains something in a detailed way.  
 
 Literary: The literary essay is a formal, academic essay in which a piece/pieces, of 
literature is/are analyzed for
 theme, characterization, style, use of figurative language, 
and/or other stylistic device. The writer expresses his or her interpretation of the 
literary work and provides evidence from the text to support his/her opinion.  
 
o Quotation Incorporation:  This is the method by which a writer defends his/her 
interpretation of a literary work. Evidence from the text is supplied in the form 
of direct quotations and/or paraphrases, followed by a page or line reference in 
parentheses, in order to convin ce the reader that the writer’s interpretation of 
the literature is sound. Strict rules govern quotation incorporation: ask your 
teacher for more details about these rules. Also see MLA formatting rules for 
more information.  
 
Organizational Techniques 
Whether they write paragraphs or essays, writers require ways of organizing their 
thoughts and often cite evidence to prove their points. The following is a short list of 
organizational possibilities and evidence types:  
 
 Analogy*: An analogy is a comparison of certain similarities between two different 
things, sometimes expressed as a simile. For example: A street light is like a star in 
that both provide light at night, both are in predictable locations, both are overhead, 
and both serve no function in the daytime. 
 
 Anecdotal Evidence*:  An informal account of evidence, perhaps from an interview, 
leaving verification dependent on the credibility of the party presenting the 
evidence. (NT)  
 
 Case Study*: A detailed, intensive study of an individual unit —such as a person, 
family, social group, or corporation —that emphasizes developmental issues and 
environmental relationships. The case study analysis stresses factors that 
contribute to the success or failure of the unit, and it is written as an exemplary, 
cautionary, or instructive model for the reader.  
 
 Cause and Effect*:  An essay technique whereby the events leading up to a single 
effect are explained to the reader. What causes something to occur? The answer to 
this question is found in the cause and effect essay. 
 
 Chronological Order*: When the essay, usually a narrative, simply recites the 
events of an action in the order in which they occurred.  
 
 Climactic Order*: If an essay is organized so that the least important idea is 
presented first and the ideas build in importance to the most important idea, that 
essay is organized using climactic order. The closing of this essay is the climax, so it 
doesn’t simply trail off into feeble nothingness.  
 
29
 Compare and Contrast*:  An essay technique whereby one item or concept is 
evaluated relative to another. Both similarities 
and differences between the two 
items are explained.  
 
 Expert Testimony* : Doing research and finding out what the experts think on a 
topic, then quoting the experts so your ideas have more weight.  (NT) 
 
 Explanatory:  This essay tries to explain something to the reader, either how 
something works, or how to do something. It simply offers information to the 
reader, without trying to persuade the reader to think a certain way about the 
information.  
 
 Persuasive*:  This essay attempts to convince the reader to agree with a particular 
point of view on a topic. Persuasion is the act of persuading the reader to agree with 
the writer’s position on something. Persuasive techniques* are the methods writers 
use to convince the reader; they include appeals to logic (deduction and induction) 
and appeals to emotion (through word choice, example, repetition, hyperbole, irony, 
etc.). 
 
 Pro and Con Argument* : This method of writing offers the reader both sides of the 
argument on a topic, the pros and the cons. The reader is then able to make up his or 
her mind on the topic by him or herself.  
 
 Question and Answer* : This organizational method for writing offers the reader a 
series of questions about a topic and then answers them.  The answers to the 
questions allow the writer to convince the reader to adopt the writer’s/narrator’s 
opinion on a topic.  
 
 Statistical Evidence* : This organizational method is similar to the one on expert 
opinion. The writer does research to find out about the statistics on his or her topic, 
and then he or she quotes those statistics in order to convince the reader that the 
writer’s opinion is correct.  
 
 Research* : The writer uses researched facts and examples to prove that his or her 
idea about a topic is correct or to persuade the reader to accept his or her point of 
view. Research essays always cite sources, so the wr
iter won’t be accused of 
plagiarism, and the reader can feel confident that the writer has done enough 
research to be knowledgeable.  
 
 
Writing Styles and Language 
 
Style is the individual manner in which an author expresses his or her thoughts and 
feelings.  Style is basically determined by aspects such as diction, tone, sentences, images, 
and language.  Other stylistic devices include descriptive language, parallel construction, 
exaggeration, sentence fragments, and dialogue. Essentially, style is the way the writer 
chooses to express his or her ideas. A writer chooses a style for any piece of writing, 
whether it is a paragraph, an essay, or something else. The following lists different things 
writers play with when creating their sty
le and making their language choices:  
 
30
 Archaic Language*:  Words and phrases that are old or obsolete (no longer used). 
For example, the  archaic word smote has been replaced with the modern word hit. 
(NT) 
 
 Bias*: This is a tendency in a person that prevents objective consideration of an 
issue. Bias is a form or prejudice, in that a person might be partial to a particular 
way of seeing something and try to influence others accordingly. Bias is a form of 
favouritism. 
 
 Cliché*: An idea that has been so frequently stated over time that it has lost its 
impact  through excessive use.  Clichés are too familiar to readers to have any 
powerful effect on them, and thus ar e best avoided by writers. For example, “It was 
a dark and stormy night” is a cliché.   
 
    Colloquial Language*: The informal language of conversation (not acceptable   
when writing essays and repor
ts) that often makes a character seem more “real” 
and beli evable. Words such as “blab”, “okay”, “check it out”, and “surf the web” are 
colloquial. When someone uses colloquial language, s/he is using a colloquialism*. 
This type of language is also known as slang. 
 
 Description: The use of sensory appeals (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) and 
poetic language to make powerful writing. The goal of description is to have the 
reader live the experience described in the writing.  
 
 Diction*:  Choice and use of words in speech or writing —a style of speaking or 
writing results from a deliberate choice and arrangement of words in a story/essay.  
Each writer uses diction appropriate to his or her purpose, subject, essay type, and 
style.  
 
 Didactic*: A didactic style is a formal kind of writing that is used when the writer 
wants to teach something important, usually a lesson on morality, ethics, politics, or 
something of that nature. If the writer is not careful, this kind of writing can make 
the reader feel he or she is being lectured or preached at (“You should…”).  
 
 Formal* and Informal* Language: Formal language is writing that is deliberate 
and dignified; it avoids partial sentences, most contractions, colloquial expression, 
and slang. Informal language is writing that resembles everyday casual conversation 
and communication with no regard for formality; this type of language incorporates 
slang, idiomatic expressions, partial sentences, and contractions. Informal language 
is the representation of speech in writing. For example, a writer depicting a party 
would have the characters use informal language at the party itself, while formal 
language would be used when the characters explain the party to a police officer.  
 
 Idiom *: A phrase that can’t be translated literally into another language because the 
meaning isn’t the same a s the words that make up the phrase. There are thousands 
of idioms in English. For example: “it is raining cats and dogs”; “flat broke”; and 
“going to hell in a hand -basket.” (NT)  
 
31
 Historical Reference*: Used as a persuasive technique, a historical reference is 
when a writer cites something that occurred in the past to support his or her 
argument.  
 
 Irony*: When there is a surprising gap between what might be expected and what 
actually occurs. There are three different kinds of irony (see your “Story 
Termin ology” handout), but verbal irony is the type most frequently used in essay 
writing.  Verbal irony occurs when the opposite of what is said is actually meant 
(sarcasm is an extreme form of verbal irony). (NT) 
 
 Jargon*:  Words or expressions developed for use within a specific group (e.g. 
technology, science, education) that are often meaningless to people outside of that 
group. For example: megabytes, feedback, guesstimate. 
 
 Juxtaposition*: The deliberate placing together of two or more thoughts, images or 
other elements that emphasize each other through their side- by-side placement. 
Juxtaposition is a form of contrast.  
 
 Objective*: In objective writing, the author relies more on hard evidence and logical 
proof than on intuition, prejudices, anecdotal evidence, or personal interpretations. 
Objective writing is the opposite of subjective writing.  
 
 Propaganda*:  Information for readers that is designed to influence opinion, 
sometimes in unfair ways. The information may be true, or even false, but it is 
carefully selected and organized to manipulate the reader. Propaganda is often 
associated with corrupt governments, which isn’t a necessarily fair association.  
 
 Rhetorical Question*: A question for which no answer is expected —often used for 
rhetorical effect, suc h as making a point in writing. “You don’t expect me to really do 
that, do you?” is an example of a character using a rhetorical question. The implied 
answer is clearly, “No.” Rhetorical questions are often used in essay conclusions and 
can be used in a modified way to transition in the body of an essay. In this case, the 
writer concludes a paragraph with the rhetorical question and answers it as the first 
sentence of the next paragraph.  
 
 Slang*:  Another word for casual, colloquial language, which is often the form 
everyday speech takes: “I was, like,
 ya know, so INTO that movie!” or “My bad” are 
examples of slang, or colloquial, expressions.  
 
 Subjective*: In subjective writing, the author relies more on intuition, prejudices, or 
emotional appeals than on hard evidence and proof. This is the opposite of objective 
writing.  
 
 Tone*:  Tone is the author's attitude toward his/her subject or readers.  It is similar 
to tone of voice and should not be confused with mood or atmosphere.  An author's 
tone might be sarcastic, sincere, apologetic, humorous, bitter, analytic, reflective, 
nostalgic, resigned, didactic, etc.  
 
32
 Understatement *: Understatement is a form of satire or sarcasm. It achieves its 
effect through stating less than what is necessary. For example, a person might say 
to a hospitalized car crash victim, “I bet that hurt.”  
 
 Voice*:  Voice is the personality of the writing, the specific characteristics that make 
the writing unique. The voice of a piece of writing is assessed in terms of style 
and/or tone. Every writer has a unique and recognizable voice.  
 
 Wit*: Wit refers to clever, often humorous, intelligence and the ability to make 
clever remarks in an amusing way. A witty person can recognize the relationships 
between seemingly unrelated things and express those relationships with keen 
perception. Sarcasm is a form of extreme wit intended to wound or ridicule another.  
 
Sentences 
 Active Voice* and Passive Voice*: The active voice reads as more immediate and 
concise. In an active sentence, the subject performs the action.  
 Active Example : The dog bit her.  
o Active Voice:  the subject (the dog) performs the action. 
 Passive Example : She was bitten by the dog.  
o Passive Voice : the action is being described as happening to the object (she).  
Each sentence states exactly the same thing, but the active voice is preferable because using 
passive voice can create awkward sentences. Also, overuse of passive voice throughout an 
essay can cause your prose to seem flat and uninteresting.  
 
 Parallelism or Parallel Structure*: This is a good writing technique where a 
writer creates emphasis through making different parts of a sentence follow the 
same pattern.  
o Faulty Parallelism:  He spends his days working, eating, and also to hike.  
o Correction: He spends his days working, eating, and hiking. 
Other Forms of Non-Fiction Writing  
 
 Autobiography*:  An account of a person’s life written by that person.  
 Biography*: An account of a person’s life written by someone else.  
 Diary*:  Writing about, often on a daily basis, the events in a person’s life. The diary is 
a personal and private place where a person can write without an intended audience 
(though this is not always the case). Ironically, some diaries are later published, 
especially if the person is famous.  
 Editorial*: An article in a news medium (such as a newspaper, magazine, radio 
broadcast, or television broadcast) that presents the personal opinion of the publisher, 
editor, manager, or owner of the news medium. (NT)

Basics: Writing a Timed Essay 
© 2010 Jim Burke. Visit www.englishcompanion.com  for more information and resources.  Writing a brilliant essay about a topic and a text you may never have seen before is difficult! You have to think and act 
fast if you are going to write something you can turn in with pride at the end of the allotted time. After reading these 
strategies fo r writing a timed essay, consult the annotated sample prompt, rubric, and paper.  Note that most readers 
realize you are writing under difficult circumstances and are trained to “reward you for what you do well, not punish 
you for what you do wrong” as they  say when scoring the AP Literature and Composition essays.  
BEFORE  
Preview, Pick, and Prepare  
1. Preview  all prompts (if you have choices) and pick the topic about which you can write the best essay (which may 
be different from the one about which you would most like to write).  
2. Analyze the prompt, paying close attention to what you must do and include ; this means identify and underline  the 
required nouns and verbs (e.g., compare  and contrast , textual evidence  and literary devices ). 
3. Read and take useful notes ––in the margins or on a separate piece of paper ––related to your chosen prompt if you 
are writing about a text included in the test; if there is no text, proceed to the planning stage.  
Plan 
4. Generate compelling, specific ideas that are clearly related to the prompt.  
5. Gather examples, quotations, evidence, or details from appropriate  sources or the text you are analyzing.  
6. Revisit the prompt to confirm that your ideas, examples, and evidence are appropriate to the prompt.  
7. Sketch out a brief writing plan, outline , or mindmap if time allows ; indicate the key connections and ideas.  
8. Develop a thesis that is narrow and compelling, but also supportable and related to the prompt.  
9. Avoid  a formulaic thesis or restatement of the prompt itself if at all possible (to make a strong first impression)  
10. Write legibly : What the reader can’t read, they skip them, resulting in a lower grade.  
 
DURING 
Write  
11. Establish your purpose and point quickly and in a compelling voice to make a strong first impression.  
12. Use an organizational strategy appropriate to the prompt and your thesis, making sure it prevents writing a 
summary or mere description. Choosing a journey pattern, for example, gives the writer an analytical focus.  
13. Avoid  long introductions; instead, create a narrow, compelling argum ent you can then defend in the essay.  
14. Organize each body paragraph around a specific topic sentence that makes an assertion related to your thesis 
(instead of beginning with description or narration which takes time and does not advance your argument).  
15. Integrate specific examples, evidence, and details––and comment on these , explaining what the quotations or 
examples mean, why they are important, how they relate to your thesis or topic sentence.  
16. Avoid  summary; if you find yourself summarizing, keep asking y ourself, “So what?” and “Who cares?” and “How is 
that related to my claim or the point I was trying to make?”  
17. Revisit the prompt, checking that you are doing or including everything it requires.  
18. Monitor the time: You must write a complete essay with a beginning, middle, and end. Every second counts!  
19. Take time to write well: You have no time to revise, so pay attention along the way to make sure that you:  
  Pay as much attention to what  you write as you to how you write: voice and style matter!  
  Use strong v erbs, precise nouns, and a variety of sentence types appropriate to your purpose.  
  Provide effective transitions to clarify and emphasize your ideas and the connections between them.  
  Organize your ideas in paragraphs that are visibly indented, fully devel oped, and purposefully arranged.  
  Avoid  any grandstanding, editorializing, ranting, seeking pity, asking for mercy, or making excuses .  
20. Conclude the essay, tying up all your ideas, connecting them to the thesis; however, do more than just restat e what 
you have already said. Reach for the great closing line that delivers to the reader a final WOW!  
 AFTER 
Revisit and Refine  
21. Revisit the prompt and, if available, the rubric to make sure you have done everything the prompt asks.  
22. Edit and proofread as needed depending on the number, type, and severity of your errors.  
23. Follow any other minor directions for which you might be penalized: indicating which prompt you wrote about, 
attaching the prompts, scoring rubric, or notes you may have made to prepare to write.  
 Troubleshooting  
• What if you do not understand the topic or the text you must write about?  
• What if reading and writing are difficult for you and so you need more time to complete this assignment?  
• What if you write better on the computer than on paper?

Overview 
 References to sources are required when writing a formal paragraph or 
essay. These references can include 
 Poem (i.e. “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” by T.S. Eliot) 
 Short Story (i.e. “Young Goodman Br own” by Nathaniel Hawthorne) 
 Novel (i.e. Nineteen Eighty-Four  by George Orwell), 
 Play (i.e. Romeo and Juliet  by William Shakespeare) 
 Essay (i.e. “Ode to a User-Friendly Pencil” by Bonnie Laing 
 A dictionary or encyclopedia 
 A website 
 A newspaper 
 
 When referring to a source you can use indirect references.  This might 
be when you paraphrase (put into your  own words) an idea, thought, or 
passage from what you have read.  
 
With the advent of the The Matrix  films, a new camera  system is used by 
which actors and/or objects are held stationary and multiple cameras are 
used to take individual images that are later made into consecutive 
images ( “Bullet Time” ). The resulting effect almost  replicates the theory of 
time dilation where time can appear to slow down the closer one approaches the speed of light (Nova)  
NOTE: Even though I am not using a quote, I must still provide a reference to material 
that is not my ideas or thoughts

 USING  QUOTATIONS IN YOUR  WRITING  
English Department
  When referring to a source you can use direct references.  Only quote the 
most necessary portions where the words of the author are so perfect , that 
you must use them instead of using your own.  
 
In his poem “The Lovesong of J. Alfr ed Prufrock”, T.S. Eliot creates a 
marvelous juxtaposition of images that  actively engages the reader to the 
poem. The image of two lovers having a romantic stroll is sharply marred 
by the comparison spread out clear ni ght sky to a “patient etherized upon 
a table” (3). Readers are not able to romanticize the moment as Eliot continues to use jarring contrasts:  
Let us go, through certai n half-deserted streets, 
 
The muttering retreats 
Of restless nights in on e-night cheap hotels  
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells. (5-7)  
 
The lovesong  that the narrator is sharing is  subverted by his choice of 
images of the streets and the hotels. Even in these first few lines, the 
reader is aware that J. Al fred Prufrock is not your ty pical balladeer. It is as 
Jeffrey Hunter remarks in his Contemporary Literary Criticism a “dramatic 
monologue” of a man who is “physi cally and spiritually bleak” (Hunter) 
 
NOTE: Short quotes use page or line numbers (if only one source is used). Quotes 
longer than 2 sentences or 2 lines of poet ry should be offset from the text.  
 NOTE: Use the Works cited references on sharepoint to help with your citations or http://citationmachine.net/
 and choose MLA

Tone and Formality in Academic Writing  
 
Being aware of one’s audience is a crucial part of successful writing, whether 
you are writing an e-mail to a friend, a memo to a business colleague, or formal paper for a class. Writers need to consider what the a udience’s 
expectations are, what assumptions they can and can’t make about their audience, and what kind of attitude/personality comes through in their writing. Tone, a term for your manner of expression in speech or writing, is another way of saying “attitude,” as in the attitude your readers perceive when they peruse your text. Many times, writers inadvertently choose an inappropriate tone for their writing, which can cause misunderstandings and frustration.  
 
Tone exists in speech, too, but when you are speaking to someone else, your body language and vocal inflections give cues about your attitude, so misunderstandings are less frequent. But writing lacks those cues; with only the words on the page, you have to make your attitude clear to your readers. This is no simple feat, and it might take some practice. 
Imagine that you’re hungry and looking for a friend to go to lunch with. How would you ask that person to join you? Now imagine that you’re asking your grandmother the same question. What about your boss? A client? Your professor? The president? You would probably 
choose different phrasing for each of these individuals. Why is that?  
When you sit down to write, consider whether your audience falls into one of these categories (or others you might have thought of). Try to choose 
language that seems appropriate for that audience.  
 
Academic writing typically requires a formal, professional tone. To make your writing more formal and “academic -sounding,” try some of the suggestions 
below.  
1. Avoid using yo u, your, etc.  These pronouns make your writing sound 
like you are addressing a single individual rather than the wider, general 
audience that academic writing usually targets.  
2. Eliminate contractions and slang.  Contractions (like isn’t, don’t, you’re , 
etc.) are considered too informal and conversational for academic writing. 
39
Slang is appropriate for conversations and e-mails, but not research papers, 
or other formal writing. If you’re not sure if it’s slang, pick another word or phrase just to be on the safe side.  
3. Avoid run -on sentences. Run-on sentences are common in speech and 
other informal interactions because we just keep adding on to something we wanted to say. In writing, however, these run -ons become distracting and 
hard to follow.  
4. Leave the IM spellings and capitalization quirks in Instant 
Messenger.  Yes, “r u comin? i c u there!” makes sense in cyberspace, but 
you need to abide by standard spelling, punctuation, and capitalization in formal academic writing. ( Hint: The same goes for e-mailin g professors, as 
well as current/potential employers.)
