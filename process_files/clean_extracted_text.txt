A title is a crucial part of your writing that attracts and piques the reader's interest in your writing. 
Many writers think they must title their piece at the start, instead of writing it at the end when they have a clear idea of what they want to say.

The main idea is connected to the thesis or topic sentence. 
It is designed to attract and pique the reader’s interest in your writing. 
To write one, relate a dramatic anecdote, expose a commonly held belief, present surprising facts and statistics, use a fitting quotation, ask a provocative question, tell a vivid anecdote, define a key term, present an interesting observation, or create a unique scenario.

port your introductory sentence with relevant facts. You may need to gather more facts on the topic to provide a solid foundation for your writing. 

You can find more facts by researching and collecting information from credible sources. Some possible sources include academic journals, books, and online databases. 

Once you have a list of facts, you can write down your own ideas and perspectives on the topic. Consider why the topic is important and why it should interest your audience.
Organize your facts and ideas in a way that develops your main idea. Once you have chosen the most important point of your paragraph or essay, you must find the best way to tell your reader about it. Look at the facts you have written. Look at your own ideas on the topic. Decide which facts and ideas will best support the main idea of your paragraph. Once you have chosen the facts and ideas you plan to use, ask yourself which order to put them in the paragraph.
correct them. Check your spelling and grammar. Read your paragraph again to ensure everything makes sense. Ensure each sentence has a subject and that subjects and verbs agree. Check the verb tenses of each sentence. Verify that each sentence is logical.

Style and organization are also crucial. Ensure your paragraph has a topic sentence that clearly states the main idea. Supporting sentences should focus on the main idea and be relevant. A closing sentence should wrap up the paragraph. Verify that all sentences stay focused on the main idea. Finally, consider whether your paragraph is engaging and interesting.

The publishing stage involves producing a final version of your paragraph. Make a paper or digital copy. Share or submit your work to a teacher, tutor, or parent. Ask for feedback on how to improve your writing.

uld be the real topic sentence, where the author puts their maximum effort. Each sentence should build on and transition to ideas in the previous sentence, using pronouns with clear antecedents.

For example, students who complain about paragraph guidelines are wrong, as they are clearly not well-informed. The second sentence uses the pronoun "they" with the antecedent "students" in the previous sentence.

Exploratory sentences help the author clarify their views by comparing and contrasting them with the material being explained. This exploration clarifies the author's preconceptions, allowing them to be critically evaluated.
ht have thought about the issue before you encountered the new material you explained. Exploratory sentences identify some conflict, confusion, or agreement between the new material and the author's preconceptions that can serve as the basis for further analysis. 

Evidence can come in several forms, including examples, illustrations, quotes, and data. Examples are used to support a point by telling a story based on your experience or common knowledge. Quotes from a text can be used to support a point, but must be introduced and not started as a sentence.
g fallacies or logic. 
Just providing evidence is not enough, especially when the evidence is a quote. You need to analyze the evidence to explain why it supports the idea of the paragraph. For example, Dr. King says segregation substitutes an "I-it" relationship for an "I-thou" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. 

When he uses the word "thou", he invokes a sense of respect. Ideally, your analysis should go beyond the evidence you provide from other sources to offer new insights into the topic. Do this by drawing novel connections between sources, examining similarities between contrasting views, identifying differences between similar views, or exploring your own unique ideas on the topic.

The "TIQs" section provides the core of your writing, integrating quotes to support your ideas. This section should have three key elements: thesis, ideas, and integrated quotes for support. 

Your Integrated Quotes or IQ should be used strategically to support your thesis, following the STATE, QUOTE, CLARIFY method.

When interpreting a piece of literature, it's essential to show your understanding of the work and its application to life. Readers want to know your thoughts and how you connect the dots. There are multiple interpretations possible, and being open to this is crucial.

To present your ideas effectively, refer to the text by summarizing, paraphrasing, or quoting. A combination of these methods is usually the most effective way to convey your interpretation.
can identify a clear progression in Charlie Gordon's desires throughout the narrative. A pivotal quote early on reveals his primary objective: "When I become intelligent like Doctor Strauss with three times my I.Q. of 68, then maybe people will like me and be friendly" (Keyes). This statement sets the stage for a sequence of ideas that explore the evolution of Charlie's desires using the State-Quote-Clarify approach. 

We can start by stating that Charlie's initial desire is to gain social acceptance and friendship, as evidenced by the quote above.

Now we just need three quotes from the poem to prove our theme: one from the beginning, one from near the middle, and one from near the end. These will be presented using the state/quote/clarify method.

a. Quote 1: From the very beginning of the poem, the speaker has withdrawn, "I am a rock, I am an island." This line sets the tone for the rest of the poem, establishing the speaker's emotional distance and isolation.

b. Quote 2: In the middle of the poem, the speaker is more explicit about his withdrawal, saying, "I've been a pawn in a game I can't afford to play / And I'm going to return quite soon." This line highlights the speaker's feelings of powerlessness and his desire to escape the emotional pain he's experiencing.

c. Quote 3: Near the end of the song, the speaker reiterates his emotional state, "I am a rock, I am an island / And a rock feels no pain / And an island never cries." This final repetition of the opening line drives home the speaker's emotional numbness and his desire to avoid feeling pain.

By using allusion, Atwood creates a poem that makes connections for the reader. 

Atwood creates a poem that makes the reader think of men going to their deaths lured onto the rocks by mythical creatures of the past. 

The woman of the poem is given a deep pathos; she cannot resist her own abilities and nature and is just as doomed as those she lures to their deaths.

His fears include the war, disappointing his father, dying, and his fellow soldiers. He feels he has no control over his reality, and is judged by his father and comrades. This disorients and unnerves him, making him doubt himself and others. He's not in control of his actions or emotions. 

He thinks about telling his parents after the war, wanting to make his mother proud and impress his father by being a "real soldier". This makes him self-conscious and focused on the future, second-guessing himself. He wants to get away from the killing zone and the jungle, thinking that reaching the beach will make everything okay.

This anxiety is so intense that even the beach, a place he thought would bring him relief, fails to calm him.

His ultimate goal is to find peace and security, which he believes can only be achieved once he returns home safely.

material, provide 2-3 excellent quotes that help prove your thesis. 
"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." - Socrates. 
This quote proves that people are inherently selfish by highlighting the idea that people are often driven by their own self-interest and desires, even when it comes to knowledge and understanding. 

"The meek shall inherit the earth, but I prefer to be a little less meek." - Charlie Chaplin. 
This quote shows that even someone as well-known for his humility as Charlie Chaplin still acknowledges that being meek may not be the most effective approach, implying that people are often more driven by their own ambitions and desires.

"Man is the only animal that blushes. Or should he be a little less vain." - Mark Twain. 
This quote highlights the human tendency to prioritize appearance and self-image, which is a fundamental aspect of selfishness.

Now Write it: 
People are inherently selfish and only care about their own needs and desires. This is evident in the way individuals prioritize their own interests and ambitions over the needs of others. For example, as Socrates noted, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing," which suggests that people are often driven by their own self-interest and desires, even when it comes to knowledge and understanding. This is also reflected in the words of Charlie Chaplin, who said, "The meek shall inherit the earth, but I prefer to be a little less meek," implying that people often prioritize their own ambitions over humility. Additionally, Mark Twain's quote, "Man is the only animal that blushes. Or should he be a little less vain," highlights the human tendency to prioritize appearance and self-image, which is a fundamental aspect of selfishness.

tions Studies, much of your university work is assessed by essay. If you learn how to prepare, organize, and present essays, you will do better in your degree overall. 

To prepare for an essay, you need to have a good understanding of the subject and the broader area it falls within. Research is the essential basis of an essay. 

You will start writing by organizing your notes, using the information you've researched.
ll-thought-out structure is crucial for a good essay. 

To create a good structure, you need:

1. A solid introduction with your interpretation of the question and a thesis statement that you'll explore in the body of the essay.
2.

To write a good conclusion, you need to revisit the main question or topic and answer it based on the evidence presented in the essay.
material in a way that flows logically from one area to the next. Each section or argument should build upon the previous one, creating a cohesive narrative that leads the reader to a triumphant conclusion.

Traditional essay structures can be unimaginative and may result in low marks. Instead, consider identifying a few key themes within your discussion and organizing your essay around them. Analyze each theme in a way that builds towards the conclusion, creating a cohesive and compelling narrative.

If you're struggling to get started, try brainstorming phrases that summarize your thoughts on the subject, including different questions and ideas you've had.

Style as well as substance matters. Good writing is not just about having good ideas, but also about expressing them well. It's wasteful to lose marks due to poor writing style. 

Avoid waffle and padding: remove unnecessary words, phrases, or sentences. If a sentence still makes sense without a word, remove it. The same applies to whole sentences.

This includes what Dyke did, why he might be seen as power-crazed or weak, and how he demonstrated personal power. This allows for lots of analysis.
solution is to be more assertive by saying "However, this argument is weak, since..." to show you're making your own argument and back it up with evidence. Your writing style is crucial because a badly-written essay will lose you marks, and in the real world, it will lose you readers. This includes books, screenplays, company reports, letters, and even job applications. Clear and proper writing with good sentence structure and punctuation is essential. Spelling mistakes are also a turn-off.
