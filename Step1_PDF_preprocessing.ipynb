      "fact, often nothing really happens at all in a descriptive paragraph. These paragraphs \n",
      "are like written photographs in that they simply describe a scene.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Expository* Paragraph:  This paragraph is the basis for the typical essay written for \n",
      "school. In a single paragraph, the writer either persuades the reader to a particular \n",

      "read in a single sitting) that analyses a subject or offers an argument on a topic. “ Essais ” \n",

      " \n",
      "An essay is comprised of a minimum of three paragraphs. There isn’t really a magic number \n",
      "of paragraphs.  A typical “canned” structure for an essay is the five paragraph form.  T he \n",

      " Introduction:  This is the first paragraph or two of an essay and is where the reader is \n",

      "the theme in a short story.  Usually, the thesis is stated explicitly, most often in the \n",

      "B. Types of Essays \n",
      "Essays can be either formal* or informal, depending on the language and style selected by \n",
      "the writer (see language and style below). There are many different types of essays, \n",
      "including narrative, but four main categories follow. In general, the narrative, descriptive, \n",
      "and personal essays are informal while the expository and literary are formal, but even \n",
      "these guidelines are flexible.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Descriptive*:  An essay in which the main objective is to engage the senses and convey \n",
      "the essence of a character and/or place rather than plot (as in a narrative essay) or \n",
      "ideas (as in an expository essa y). Just as an artist’s paint strokes can capture a \n",

      " \n",
      " Personal*: The personal essay is an extension of the narrative and/or descriptive \n",
      "paragraphs described above. In i\n",
      "t, a writer describes a situation in which he/she \n",
      "learned something profound or discovered something about life. These essays are \n",
      "written in first person point of view.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Expository*:  This is the most common essay form used in school. Expository essays \n",
      "persuade or explain, are written in third person point of view, and follow a fairly strict \n",
      "format. Typical expository essay writing techniques (HOW a writer explains or \n",
      "28\n",
      "persuades) include cause and effect and compare/contrast, although there are many, \n",
      "many more other approaches. Exposition is therefore writing that conveys information \n",
      "or explains something in a detailed way.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Literary: The literary essay is a formal, academic essay in which a piece/pieces, of \n",
      "literature is/are analyzed for\n",
      " theme, characterization, style, use of figurative language, \n",
      "and/or other stylistic device. The writer expresses his or her interpretation of the \n",
      "literary work and provides evidence from the text to support his/her opinion.  \n",
      " \n",
      "o Quotation Incorporation:  This is the method by which a writer defends his/her \n",

      "more information.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Organizational Techniques \n",
      "Whether they write paragraphs or essays, writers require ways of organizing their \n",
      "thoughts and often cite evidence to prove their points. The following is a short list of \n",
      "organizational possibilities and evidence types:  \n",
      " \n",
      " Analogy*: An analogy is a comparison of certain similarities between two different \n",
      "things, sometimes expressed as a simile. For example: A street light is like a star in \n",
      "that both provide light at night, both are in predictable locations, both are overhead, \n",
      "and both serve no function in the daytime. \n",
      " \n",
      " Anecdotal Evidence*:  An informal account of evidence, perhaps from an interview, \n",
      "leaving verification dependent on the credibility of the party presenting the \n",
      "evidence. (NT)  \n",
      " \n",
      " Case Study*: A detailed, intensive study of an individual unit —such as a person, \n",
      "family, social group, or corporation —that emphasizes developmental issues and \n",
      "environmental relationships. The case study analysis stresses factors that \n",
      "contribute to the success or failure of the unit, and it is written as an exemplary, \n",
      "cautionary, or instructive model for the reader.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Cause and Effect*:  An essay technique whereby the events leading up to a single \n",
      "effect are explained to the reader. What causes something to occur? The answer to \n",
      "this question is found in the cause and effect essay. \n",
      " \n",
      " Chronological Order*: When the essay, usually a narrative, simply recites the \n",
      "events of an action in the order in which they occurred.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Climactic Order*: If an essay is organized so that the least important idea is \n",
      "presented first and the ideas build in importance to the most important idea, that \n",
      "essay is organized using climactic order. The closing of this essay is the climax, so it \n",
      "doesn’t simply trail off into feeble nothingness.  \n",
      " \n",
      "29\n",
      " Compare and Contrast*:  An essay technique whereby one item or concept is \n",
      "evaluated relative to another. Both similarities \n",
      "and differences between the two \n",
      "items are explained.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Expert Testimony* : Doing research and finding out what the experts think on a \n",
      "topic, then quoting the experts so your ideas have more weight.  (NT) \n",
      " \n",
      " Explanatory:  This essay tries to explain something to the reader, either how \n",
      "something works, or how to do something. It simply offers information to the \n",
      "reader, without trying to persuade the reader to think a certain way about the \n",
      "information.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Persuasive*:  This essay attempts to convince the reader to agree with a particular \n",
      "point of view on a topic. Persuasion is the act of persuading the reader to agree with \n",
      "the writer’s position on something. Persuasive techniques* are the methods writers \n",
      "use to convince the reader; they include appeals to logic (deduction and induction) \n",
      "and appeals to emotion (through word choice, example, repetition, hyperbole, irony, \n",
      "etc.). \n",
      " \n",
      " Pro and Con Argument* : This method of writing offers the reader both sides of the \n",
      "argument on a topic, the pros and the cons. The reader is then able to make up his or \n",
      "her mind on the topic by him or herself.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Question and Answer* : This organizational method for writing offers the reader a \n",
      "series of questions about a topic and then answers them.  The answers to the \n",
      "questions allow the writer to convince the reader to adopt the writer’s/narrator’s \n",
      "opinion on a topic.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Statistical Evidence* : This organizational method is similar to the one on expert \n",
      "opinion. The writer does research to find out about the statistics on his or her topic, \n",
      "and then he or she quotes those statistics in order to convince the reader that the \n",
      "writer’s opinion is correct.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Research* : The writer uses researched facts and examples to prove that his or her \n",
      "idea about a topic is correct or to persuade the reader to accept his or her point of \n",
      "view. Research essays always cite sources, so the wr\n",
      "iter won’t be accused of \n",
      "plagiarism, and the reader can feel confident that the writer has done enough \n",
      "research to be knowledgeable.  \n",

      "Writing Styles and Language \n",
      " \n",
      "Style is the individual manner in which an author expresses his or her thoughts and \n",
      "feelings.  Style is basically determined by aspects such as diction, tone, sentences, images, \n",
      "and language.  Other stylistic devices include descriptive language, parallel construction, \n",
      "exaggeration, sentence fragments, and dialogue. Essentially, style is the way the writer \n",
      "chooses to express his or her ideas. A writer chooses a style for any piece of writing, \n",
      "whether it is a paragraph, an essay, or something else. The following lists different things \n",
      "writers play with when creating their sty\n",
      "le and making their language choices:  \n",
      " \n",
      "30\n",
      " Archaic Language*:  Words and phrases that are old or obsolete (no longer used). \n",
      "For example, the  archaic word smote has been replaced with the modern word hit. \n",
      "(NT) \n",
      " \n",
      " Bias*: This is a tendency in a person that prevents objective consideration of an \n",
      "issue. Bias is a form or prejudice, in that a person might be partial to a particular \n",
      "way of seeing something and try to influence others accordingly. Bias is a form of \n",
      "favouritism. \n",
      " \n",
      " Cliché*: An idea that has been so frequently stated over time that it has lost its \n",
      "impact  through excessive use.  Clichés are too familiar to readers to have any \n",
      "powerful effect on them, and thus ar e best avoided by writers. For example, “It was \n",
      "a dark and stormy night” is a cliché.   \n",
      " \n",
      "    Colloquial Language*: The informal language of conversation (not acceptable   \n",
      "when writing essays and repor\n",
      "ts) that often makes a character seem more “real” \n",
      "and beli evable. Words such as “blab”, “okay”, “check it out”, and “surf the web” are \n",
      "colloquial. When someone uses colloquial language, s/he is using a colloquialism*. \n",
      "This type of language is also known as slang. \n",
      " \n",
      " Description: The use of sensory appeals (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) and \n",
      "poetic language to make powerful writing. The goal of description is to have the \n",
      "reader live the experience described in the writing.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Diction*:  Choice and use of words in speech or writing —a style of speaking or \n",
      "writing results from a deliberate choice and arrangement of words in a story/essay.  \n",
      "Each writer uses diction appropriate to his or her purpose, subject, essay type, and \n",
      "style.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Didactic*: A didactic style is a formal kind of writing that is used when the writer \n",
      "wants to teach something important, usually a lesson on morality, ethics, politics, or \n",
      "something of that nature. If the writer is not careful, this kind of writing can make \n",
      "the reader feel he or she is being lectured or preached at (“You should…”).  \n",
      " \n",
      " Formal* and Informal* Language: Formal language is writing that is deliberate \n",
      "and dignified; it avoids partial sentences, most contractions, colloquial expression, \n",
      "and slang. Informal language is writing that resembles everyday casual conversation \n",
      "and communication with no regard for formality; this type of language incorporates \n",
      "slang, idiomatic expressions, partial sentences, and contractions. Informal language \n",
      "is the representation of speech in writing. For example, a writer depicting a party \n",
      "would have the characters use informal language at the party itself, while formal \n",
      "language would be used when the characters explain the party to a police officer.  \n",
      " \n",
